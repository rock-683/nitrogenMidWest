## Project Background
BioSand Population Health Institute is a mock public health non-profit located in and serving the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 7 ( Mid West).

The organization compiles regional health and environmental data, including behaviors, socioeconomic factors, and physical environment metrics (air quality, nitrogen levels in fertilizer). This project analyzes and synthesizes this data to 1) assess the health risks of nitrogen pollution on low birthweight and 2) develop a health risk assessment, guiding more effective program resource distribution and maximizing impact.

**Problem**. There is limited understanding of how nitrogen levels relate to key health outcomes in the Midwest, creating challenges for planning and targeting prevention efforts.
